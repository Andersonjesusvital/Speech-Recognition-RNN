# 🎤🔊 Speech Recognition RNN 📝🤖

Welcome to the Speech Recognition RNN repository, a cutting-edge deep learning-based subtitle generation model designed to process audio datasets and generate accurate text transcriptions. This repository includes all the necessary components such as audio feature extraction, encoder-decoder architecture, training pipelines, and evaluation metrics for precise subtitle alignment.

## 📁 Repository Contents

### 🎙️ Audio Processing
Our model incorporates robust audio processing techniques to extract essential features from the input audio data. This ensures that our speech recognition system accurately captures the nuances of the spoken language.

### 🧠 Deep Learning
Powered by advanced deep learning algorithms, our model leverages the capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and transformer models to effectively transcribe audio input into text output.

### 🏗️ Encoder-Decoder Architecture
The encoder-decoder architecture used in our model enables seamless translation of audio signals into textual representations. This architecture plays a crucial role in achieving high accuracy in speech-to-text conversion.

### 📝 Natural Language Processing
By integrating natural language processing (NLP) techniques, our model enhances the quality of text transcriptions produced from audio inputs. This ensures that the generated subtitles are not only accurate but also contextually meaningful.

### 🤖 RNN and Transformer Models
Our model employs recurrent neural networks (RNN) and transformer models to analyze audio data and generate corresponding text sequences. These models are tailored to handle the complexities of speech recognition tasks effectively.

### 🎙️ Speech Recognition
The core functionality of our model revolves around speech recognition, enabling users to convert spoken audio content into written text with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.

### 📄 Subtitle Generation
Through the integration of sophisticated algorithms, our model excels at generating subtitles for audio content, making it an indispensable tool for content creators, transcription services, and anyone working with spoken language data.

### 📦 Text Tokenization
Text tokenization is a key component of our model, allowing for the efficient parsing and processing of textual data. This process ensures that the generated subtitles are structured and coherent.

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We provide comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our model in aligning subtitles with the audio input. These metrics serve as valuable benchmarks for evaluating the accuracy and efficacy of our speech recognition system.
